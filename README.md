# Export-To-Web-HDT

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/73ldwu4nyiytwucd/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/judge2020/export-to-web-hdt-jt3fk/branch/master)


Export decks to websites through HDT

At startup the plugin will try to download the data file, hearthpwn.txt which is generated using [this tool](https://github.com/judge2020/HearthPwn-cardId-gen).

This release has basic functionality of exporting the ACTIVE deck to hearthpwn. This is not the selected deck, rather the deck in use. You will need to double click the deck to start "using" it and then you can export it.

This also has basic crash reporting, however you will need a github account.
